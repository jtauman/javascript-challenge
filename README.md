Download all the files in the UFO-level-1 folder.  Open up the index.html file in a browser and the page should display a table of UFO sightings with columns for date, city, state, country, shape of the ufo, duration of the encounter, and comments regarding the encounter.  To filter the table based on the encounter date, enter a date between 1/1/2010 - 1/13/2010 (*be sure to format your dates as listed!*) to filter the ufo sightings table by date.

After entering in a valid date, the webpage should look like this:
